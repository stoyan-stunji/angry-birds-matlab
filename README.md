A very simple interpretation of the popular mobile game Angry Birds made in MatLab.

Functions:
+ The user can choose the initial starting point of the bird object by simply writing in the desired values in the X and Y box, and pressing the UPDATE button;
+  The user can choose the trajectory and the launch force of the bird object by moving the second point of the trajectory line in the designated box;
+ By pressing the START button, the bird object will be launched. After a certain amounth of time, the bird object will moved back to its original starting point (0, 70);
+ The bird object is based on the character Red from the Angry Birds franchise.

Instalation:
+ Simply download the two files and place them in the folder chosen for running .m files/scripts;
+     PS C:\Users\User\> cd "C:\Program Files\MATLAB\Version\bin" 
+     PS C:\Program Files\MATLAB\Version\bin .\matlab.exe .\untitled.m
